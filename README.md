# PdfDataScraping

This is a robot the scrapes data from Pdf files and writes them on a excel sheet

We open invoices from a directory assigned on a fileList, Build a DataTable for this invoices and For each invoice, we open to scrape data and add a row to the DataTable then close the Pdf, after all invoices were scraped we write all data of DataTable on an excel sheet.
(There is two directories on this project, one with 5 invoices and another with 1000 invoices, all you have to do is change the directory assigned to the fileList.)
